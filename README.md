#### What is Kitchenly you ask?

Kitchenly aims to be an easier alternative to searching and saving recipes. Looking up a recipe typically involves clicking through links, making sure to dodge all the blog posts and notifications to sign up for newsletters that a website will throw at you, and just giving the user the actual recipe with options for saving, adding it to a board, etc. All in all, I wanted to create a recipe app to simplify the process of searching.
